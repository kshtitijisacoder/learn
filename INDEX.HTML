<b>Now what is coding? How can i do it??</b><u> Answer to these kinds of questions are really simple coding is the process of writting\making computer programs</u>.<b>
Where can we do coding exactly.We an do coding on diffrent platforms like python,java,(HTML</b>
 which we are learning now) Now lets learn HTML webpage making.  <br>{but this will not appear in chrome as it will be saved in the files i will tell about this at the end} <br>


All the codes are done in notepad and these are the basics of HTML<br>
  Note: plz do not use the " as it shown here for learning purpose & u dont use it while making a website<hr>

 
<b>Now lets start</b>.<br>

<i>type "<" html ">"          <br>

 then, type "<" head ">"     <br>                       

next type "<"title">"     <br>

then, type the title u think it should have.Example: music webpage <br>

then type "<"/"title">"<br>

then type "<"body">"<br>

next type what the body should be.Example: hi i will teach u how to sing <br>

then,type </"body"<" <br>

then at the end type <"/html">"</i> <hr>

<br>


now your website is completely ready,<br>

now u need to save the file in folder and if u had done steps correctly. <br>

right click that file <br>

hover over open with<br>

now click on chrome and u will see something like this:

<font face="calibri"> Now as i told you that this is not visible on chrome directly because you need a <b>DOMAIN </b>(a DOMAIN can be bought by purchasing one for INR) to upload it publicly and you would be wondering that how i am able to see the website on my dekstop\laptop\tablet\phone You can see it as you directly have the html file in your dekstop\laptop\tablet\phone.<br></font>
